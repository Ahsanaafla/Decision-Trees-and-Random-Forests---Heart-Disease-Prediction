# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests---Heart-Disease-Prediction


This project applies Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms to the Heart Disease dataset.

## Dataset

Used the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier.
3. Visualized the Decision Tree.
4. Analyzed overfitting by limiting tree depth.
5. Trained a Random Forest Classifier.
6. Compared model accuracy.
7. Plotted feature importances.
8. Evaluated models using cross-validation.

## Results

- Decision Tree Accuracy: (depends on run)
- Random Forest Accuracy: (depends on run)
- Cross-validation accuracy also computed.
